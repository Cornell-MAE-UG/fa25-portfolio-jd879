## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a curious and hard-working mechanical engineering student with a broad range of interests and experience, including aerospace structures & mechanisms, automotive design, and manufacturing.
I have been eager to gain aerospace engineering experience since high school. Although I have the most experience with structures and mechanisms, I am eager to learn more about manufacturing processes, propulsion & fluid systems, and thermal systems.

Most of my structures experience has come from my two internships: first as a Pathways intern for the Launch Accessories branch at Kennedy Space Center during the Spring 2025 semester, and next as a Structures intern at Stoke Space in Kent, Washington.

Aside from my design experience, I have an additional background in machining and welding which I firmly believe has strengthened my design-for-manufacturing skills and understanding of manufacturing and fabrication processes. 

I also come from a strong leadership background -- I was a L'SPACE LEAP Intern for the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters, through which I gained experience mentoring students and providing feedback on CAD and design for space systems. I have worked in Cornell's machine shop as an intern and training instructor, and I have trained over 50 students on the safe and proper usage of manual mills and lathes. This Fall, I'll be one of three training managers leading a team of over 20 student trainers.
